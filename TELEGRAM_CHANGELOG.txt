As you asked for us to release more updates, here you go, Lawnchair 14 beta 2! 
Jokes asides, we are fixing some of the issues with our first Lawnchair 14 beta release:

* Fix Lawnchair crashing on Android 9 and some Lenovo devices on Android 10
* Fix spacing issue within the announcement settings
* Fix "Apps and Shortcuts" being tied to "Files" suggestion in Drawer Search settings
* Add support for force resizing widgets/unlimited resizing options (thanks to <a href="https://github.com/SolidTux">@SolidTux</a> for their PR!)

Alongside that, after discussion with the team, we have changed the package name back to `app.lawnchair` because of the Play Store update conflicts.
