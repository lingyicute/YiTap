Lawnchair 14 Beta 2 is here! Compared to the previous release, this version contains the following improvements:

* Fix Lawnchair crashing on Android 9 and some Lenovo devices on Android 10
* Fix spacing issue within the announcement settings
* Fix "Apps and Shortcuts" being tied to "Files" suggestion in Drawer Search settings
* Add support for force resizing widgets/unlimited resizing options (thanks to @SolidTux for their PR!)

Alongside that, after discussion with the team, we have changed the package name back to `app.lawnchair` because of the Play Store update conflicts.
